The Battleship board game in Python (Console Version)

To play, download main.py and run. (You will need to have python3 installed on your computer)
Enjoy! :)

Note:
In the code there are two functions called "solve(m)" and "play(m)".
The "play(m)" function is called in the top of the main while loop for the game.
If you replace "play(m)" with "solve(m)" and use "grid" as the arument, 
the game will solve itself.

Another Note:
If you would like to see the "map" of the battle field as you are playing, 
you can call the "display_map(m)" function at the very bottom of the main while loop.
Just make sure to pass "grid" as the argument.
